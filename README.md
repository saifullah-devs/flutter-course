# 🦋 Flutter Full Stack Application (In Progress)

> A journey from **Flutter basics** to a **complete full-stack mobile app** with backend, APIs, and database integration.
> Developed and maintained by **Saifullah Asif** 👨‍💻

## 📘 Overview

This project begins as a **Flutter front-end learning app** and will gradually evolve into a **Full Stack Flutter Application**.
The aim is to understand and build every layer — from **UI design**, to **API communication**, and finally to **backend logic & data persistence**.
